	<h1>Pituitary Gland</h1>
	<div class="information">
		<p>The pituitary gland protrudes off the bottom of the hypothalamus and is located at the base of the brain. Its main functions are to trigger the onset of puberty, regulate blood pressure, and produce Human Growth Hormone (HGH). An overative pituitary gland can lead to a condition called gigantism where a person grows excessively. An underactive pituitary gland, on the other hand, results in a condition called dwarfism where a person grows at a very slow rate.</p>
